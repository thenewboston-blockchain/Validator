    Description:

    - notice from a previous confirmation validator that they are now a primary validator
    - triggered from an /upgrade_request from the validators most trusted bank
    - banks that trust self more than their existing primary validator will set self as new primary validator
    - banks that do not trust self more than their existing primary validator will remain on their existing network and
      can therefore be deleted

    Responses:
    - 200 response > bank set self as new primary validator
    - 400 response > bank is remaining on their existing network (can be deleted)

    Notes:
        The requesting (most trusted) bank may be excluded from notice recipients since it will already receive the
        updated information from the /upgrade_request response
